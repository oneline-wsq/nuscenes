# Sentence label generation based on nuScenes dataset

This code allows you to generate sentence label based on nuScenes dataset. The concept of the sentence label comes from Tesla's AI day in 2021. In the AI day sharing, they proposed an autoregressive lane language model.

Inspired by this, we decided to build and train a similar model on a publicly available dataset. This repository is focused on the preliminary data preparation and the generation of the labels required for network training.
